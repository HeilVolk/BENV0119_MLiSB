# BENV0119 Machine Learning in Smart Buildings
A repository for the code tutorials for the BENV0119 Machine Learning in Smart Buildings module at UCL IEDE.

All of the tutorials for the module will be added here as well as on Moodle. It is likely easiest to clone this repo, then update it as new materials for each week are added, rather than continually downloading from Moodle. It's up to your preference which you do!

The most straightforward way to clone/download the repository is through the [Github Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com). If you're already familiar with git/Github, feel free to clone to your local machine however you see fit.
